Refer to the film, actor, and film_actor tables of the Sakila database. The tables in this lab have the same columns and data types but fewer rows.

Write a query that:

Computes the average length of all films that each actor appears in.
Rounds average length to the nearest minute and renames the result column "average".
Displays last name, first name, and average, in that order, for each actor.
Sorts the result in descending order by average, then ascending order by last name.
The query should exclude films with no actors and actors that do not appear in films.

Hint: Use the ROUND() and AVG() functions.


SELECT a.last_name, a.first_name, ROUND(AVG(f.length)) AS 'average'

FROM film f

INNER JOIN film_actor fa ON f.film_id = fa.film_id

INNER JOIN actor a ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id

GROUP BY a.last_name, a.first_name

ORDER BY average DESC, last_name ASC;
