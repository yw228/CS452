3.14 LAB - Select lesson schedule with multiple joins
The database has three tables for tracking horse-riding lessons:

Horse with columns:

ID - primary key
RegisteredName
Breed
Height
BirthDate
Student with columns:

ID - primary key
FirstName
LastName
Street
City
State
Zip
Phone
EmailAddress
LessonSchedule with columns:

HorseID - partial primary key, foreign key references Horse(ID)
StudentID - foreign key references Student(ID)
LessonDateTime - partial primary key
Write a SELECT statement to create a lesson schedule for Feb 1, 2020 with the lesson date/time, student's first and last names, and the horse's registered name. Order the results in ascending order by lesson date/time, then by the horse's registered name. Make sure unassigned lesson times (student ID is NULL) appear in the results.

Hint: Perform a join on the LessonSchedule, Student, and Horse tables, matching the student IDs and horse IDs.


SELECT LessonDateTime,FirstName,LastName,RegisteredName
FROM LessonSchedule
LEFT JOIN Student
ON LessonSchedule.StudentID = Student.ID 
LEFT JOIN Horse
ON LessonSchedule.HorseID = Horse.ID
WHERE LessonDateTime >= "2020-02-01 00:00:00" AND LessonDateTime < '2020-02-02 00:00:00'
ORDER BY LessonDateTime ASC, RegisteredName;
