The Horse table has the following columns:

ID - integer, primary key
RegisteredName - variable-length string
Breed - variable-length string
Height - decimal number
BirthDate - date
Write a SELECT statement to select the registered name and height for only horses that have an above average height. Order the results by height.

Hint: Use a subquery to find the average height.




SELECT RegisteredName, Height 
FROM Horse
WHERE Height >
(SELECT AVG(Height)
FROM Horse
)
ORDER BY Height
